# TextEditor
A main ELF file is present in the directory. It was built on 64 bit Fedora Machine. Rest of the options used to compile the executable can be found in Makefile.
Otherwise use command
```sh
make
./main
```
to build from source in your machine.
It also accepts a command line arg, which is the name of the file if found, it will be opened in the editor else new file with that name will be created.
